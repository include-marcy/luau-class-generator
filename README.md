# Luau Class Generator
This is a utility tool designed to automatically generate the boiler plate of a specialized and professional Luau Class module. It also defines type information for the Class and defines a CreateInfo type which can be automatically generated in a configurable Types module.

# Features:
* Automatically creates a type-strict module definition of a Luau class with professional syntax usage, type definitions, and a consistent naming scheme.
* Automatically adds type information to a designated file which can instruct users of the interfaces you create about how to build the objects your library contains.
* Automatically adds Luau Dynamic/Fast Flags to the tops of class files.
* Adds a best practice configurable copyright notice to the top of files.
